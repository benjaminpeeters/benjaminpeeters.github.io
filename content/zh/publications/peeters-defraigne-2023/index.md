abstract: "This study examines balance-of-payment financial crises in semi-periphery economies, proposing the concept of Center Leader economies' Industrial-Financial cycles (CLIF cycles). We demonstrate that these medium-term cycles in center countries generate large counter-cyclical financial inflows in semi-periphery countries that subsequently create balance-of-payments crises. The research identifies three major waves of crises during the 1980s, 1994-2001, and 2008-2019 periods, each corresponding to phases of CLIF cycles."
