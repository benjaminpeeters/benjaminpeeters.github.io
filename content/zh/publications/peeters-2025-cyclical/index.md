abstract: "This paper examines the impacts of medium-term cycles in advanced economies on financial flows to the semi-periphery. We document cyclical patterns in international capital movements and analyze how business cycles in center countries influence the direction and magnitude of financial flows to semi-peripheral economies. The analysis provides evidence of systematic relationships between economic conditions in advanced economies and financial flows to developing and emerging markets."
