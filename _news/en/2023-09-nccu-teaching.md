I am joining National Chengchi University (NCCU) in Taipei, Taiwan for a teaching and research position during the 2023-2024 academic year. I will teach three courses: "European Union and International Relations" (in English), "France and International Affairs" (in French), and "Asian Industrialization". This position will also provide valuable opportunities for research collaboration on international financial flows and economic development in East Asia.
