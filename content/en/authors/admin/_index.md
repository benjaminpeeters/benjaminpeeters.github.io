I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Research Department Transformation Pathways](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/transformation-pathways) at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/home), Germany.

I hold a PhD in Economics from [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html) in Belgium.

My research focuses on empirical assessments of financial interdependencies since the 1970s, with expertise in economic history, macroeconomics, climate economics, and international finance. My work examines the cyclical patterns in international financial flows, particularly to semi-periphery countries, and explores the intersection of climate change and economic systems. I combine historical analysis with contemporary economic modeling to understand long-term financial dynamics and their implications for sustainable development.
