I am excited to announce that I have joined the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) as a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Research Department Transformation Pathways. My work focuses on examining the links between physical and financial risks of climate change through integrated assessment models, with particular emphasis on climate damages, adaptation costs, and effects on capital markets in developing nations.
