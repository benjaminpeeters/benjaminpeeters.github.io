## Books in Progress

### Financial Crises in Semi-periphery Countries

Peeters, B.; Defraigne, J.-C.

Status: In the making

This book examines a recurring pattern of balance-of-payment (BOP) financial crises in semi-peripheral economies. It introduces Industrial-Financial cycles of Center Leader economies (CLIF cycles) and demonstrates how these cycles trigger financial inflows leading to crises.

The work identifies periodic patterns in international financial flows since the 1970s and connects three major crisis waves (1980s, 1994-2001, 2008-2019) to CLIF cycle phases.

Intended for policymakers, economists, and scholars studying global financial dynamics and economic stability in developing economies.
