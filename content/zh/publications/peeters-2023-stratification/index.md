abstract: "This working paper develops a comprehensive framework for understanding center-periphery dynamics in the global economy since World War II. We provide historical context for the evolution of economic stratification between center and peripheral economies, propose a theoretical framework for analyzing these relationships, and present empirical estimations of center-periphery patterns over the post-war period. The analysis examines how structural economic relationships have evolved across different historical phases of globalization."
