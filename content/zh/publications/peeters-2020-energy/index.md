abstract: "We present a framework linking the EROEI (Energy Return On Energy Invested) concept to macroeconomic variables within an endogenous growth model. Our approach reveals a relationship between EROEI values and the capital share required for energy sector investment. The research demonstrates that transitioning to lower EROEI resources intensifies capital competition between energy and non-energy sectors, potentially causing output contraction. Key findings indicate that a protracted economic contraction may occur before the completion of the transition to renewable energy, with magnitude depending on non-renewable resource abundance, technical progress potential, and substitutability between capital and energy."
