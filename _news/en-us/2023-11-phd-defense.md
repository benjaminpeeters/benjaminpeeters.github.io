I successfully defended my doctoral thesis on "Empirical Assessments of Financial Interdependencies Since the 1970s" at UCLouvain Saint-Louis Brussels. The thesis was supervised by Alexander Girard and Jean-Christophe Defraigne and examines cyclical patterns in international financial flows, monetary policy spillovers, and medium-term financial cycles in semi-periphery countries.
