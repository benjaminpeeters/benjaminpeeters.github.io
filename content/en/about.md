## About Benjamin Peeters

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Research Department Transformation Pathways at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany.

I hold a PhD in Economics from UCLouvain in Belgium.

## Research Focus

My research focuses on empirical assessments of financial interdependencies since the 1970s, with expertise in:

- Economic history
- Macroeconomics
- Climate economics
- International finance

## Research Interests

My work examines the cyclical patterns in international financial flows, particularly to semi-periphery countries, and explores the intersection of climate change and economic systems. I combine historical analysis with contemporary economic modeling to understand long-term financial dynamics and their implications for sustainable development.
