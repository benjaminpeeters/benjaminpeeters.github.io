## About

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Research Department Transformation Pathways](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/transformation-pathways) at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/home), Germany.

I hold a PhD in Economics from [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html) in Belgium.

My research focuses on empirical assessments of financial interdependencies since the 1970s, with expertise in:

- Economic history
- Macroeconomics
- Climate economics
- International finance

## Research Interests

My work examines the cyclical patterns in international financial flows, particularly to semi-periphery countries, and explores the intersection of climate change and economic systems. I combine historical analysis with contemporary economic modeling to understand long-term financial dynamics and their implications for sustainable development.
