I am pleased to announce the launch of a redesigned version of my academic website. Built using Jekyll with the al-folio theme, this new version features improved navigation, multilingual support (English, French, Chinese), and better organization of research publications, teaching materials, and technical notes. The website is being progressively developed with new content and features.
